Diffusion equation in one dimension implemented with an explicit scheme with finite-difference methods.

This video shows the diffusion of heat on a thin metal stem with initial 0Â° temperature everywhere except on the right boundary point. This boundary point is constantly and homogeneously heated and has a temperature 1 (the equations are scaled and normalized), and this video shows how the heat is diffused in the stem. We use 100 discretization space-points (dx=dy=1/100) and 20000 discretization time-points (dt=1/20000).

The code is written in C++ and the plots are made with Gnuplot for an university project (FYS3150, University of Oslo) and is available here : https://github.com/kryzar/Calypso. You are free to use it, modify it and report comments and mistakes.
